#BS-Seeker3 
BS-Seeker3 is the latest iteration of BS-Seeker, a software that performs accurate and fast mapping of bisulfite-treated short reads. It incorpaortes several new implementation features that enable it to acheive significantly faster speed and accuracy with respect to other available bisulfite reads aligners. BS-Seeker3 also provides additional anlysis to further investigate and visualize the raw mapped read data after alignment. 
#New Features
* Implements improved indexing, fast alignment with SNAP, and a highly optimized SNAP output processing; produces an ultra-fast bisulfite read maping pipeline
* Executes Local Alignment through the Unnoken Algorithm; achieves high mappability and accuracy
* Plots Quality Control graph, outputs Meta-gene plot, and calcualtes the bisulfite reads unconversion rate; allows better visualization of the methylation data
