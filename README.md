#BS-Seeker3 
BS-Seeker3 is the latest iteration of BS-Seeker, a software that performs accurate and fast mapping of bisulfite-treated short reads. It incorpaortes several new implementation features that enable it to acheive significantly faster speed and accuracy with respect to other available bisulfite reads aligners. BS-Seeker3 also provides additional anlysis to further investigate and visualize the raw mapped read data after alignment. 
#New Features
* Implements Improved Indexing, Fast Alignment with SNAP, and Highly Optimized SNAP Output Post-Processing
    -Produces an ultra-fast bisulfite read maping pipeline
* Executes Local Alignment through the Unnoken Algorithm
    -Achieves high mappability and accuracy
* Plots Quality Control Graph, Meta-gene Plot, and Bisulfite Unconversion Rate Histogram
    -Allows better visualization of the methylation data
