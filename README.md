#BS-Seeker3 
BS-Seeker3 is the latest iteration of BS-Seeker, a software that performs accurate and fast mapping of bisulfite-treated short reads. It incorpaortes several new implementation features that enable it to acheive significantly faster speed and accuracy with respect to other available bisulfite reads aligners. BS-Seeker3 also provides additional anlysis to further investigate and visualize the raw mapped read data after alignment. 
#New Features
* Implements Improved Indexing, Fast Alignment with SNAP, and Highly Optimized SNAP Output Post-Processing
    * Produces an ultra-fast bisulfite read maping pipeline
* Executes Local Alignment through the Unnoken Algorithm
    * Achieves high mappability and accuracy
* Plots Quality Control Graph, Meta-gene Plot, and Bisulfite Unconversion Rate Histogram
    * Allows better visualization of the methylation data

#System Requirements
* Linux or Mac OS Environment
* Python (version 2.5.2 or above; it should be pre-installed in both Linux and Mac). Type 'Python' to see the installed version. Python could be downloaded from http://www.python.org/download/ )
* Python Modules 'Pysam' and 'Metplotlib'. To install the packages, use the following commands on an UNIX terminal:
<br /> ``` 'pip install pysam' ``` <br /> ```   'pip install metplolib' ```
