#BS-Seeker3 
BS-Seeker3 is the latest iteration of BS-Seeker, a software that performs accurate and fast mapping of bisulfite-treated short reads. It incorpaortes new implementation features that enable it to acheive significantly faster speed and accuracy with respect to other available bisulfite reads aligners. BS-Seeker3 also provides additional anlysis to further investigate and visualize the raw mapped read data after alignment.
